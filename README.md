# React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, I created a employee directory with React. In this application I  broke up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and made the app respond to user events using React Hooks.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Summary (What It Does)

An employee or manager can view non-sensitive data (Name, Email and Phone Number) about other employees. They are also able to filter employees by first name.

## Code Snippet

* I created a table of random users using the randomusers.me api

* I wrote a function for the user to be able to sort employee last names alpahbetically.

* I wrote a function for the user to be able to search for an employee by first name.


The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Technologies Used
